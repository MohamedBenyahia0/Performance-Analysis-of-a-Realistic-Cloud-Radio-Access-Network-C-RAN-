% FittingSNR.m - a script that demonstrates how to make a fitting on SNR
% measurements
%
% This script is a simple script to teach how to perform a polynomial fitting on
% measurement data
%
% For illustration purpose, the script starts by creating some dummy noisy data
% on which the fitting will be performed. %
