Performance Analysis of a Realistic Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN)
Project Overview
This project focuses on the performance analysis of a Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) with realistic constraints. It is divided into four key parts:

D1: Simulation of the system with ideal hardware
In this phase, we simulate the C-RAN assuming ideal hardware performance to establish a baseline. The goal is to assess the system's theoretical performance without considering hardware imperfections.

D2: Radio-frequency system and hardware modeling
Here, we introduce realistic models of radio-frequency (RF) components and hardware imperfections to analyze their impact on the system's performance.

D3: Optical point-to-point system performance
We evaluate the performance of the optical fronthaul network, which connects remote radio heads (RRHs) to the central unit (CU). This phase involves simulating the optical link performance and analyzing potential bottlenecks.

D4: Network simulation and global performance
Finally, we simulate the overall C-RAN network, combining the previous parts to assess its global performance under realistic conditions.
